  ## User Experience

### User Stories

As a user I want to:
* understand what the site is about and what help I can get from this particular organisation.
* be able to navigate intuitionally between pages.
* gain knowledge about what processes must migrants in Ireland follow and where to apply for such.
* easily obtain the information I am seeking.
* easily contactMigrants Hub for assistance.
* find some useful information that I can read on my own.

## Site Structure 

Migrants Hub is a site that consists of 4 main pages which are presented in the navigation menu. The main landing page is the [about us]() page with primary information. The user may then opt to navigate to any of the other pages ([services](), [useful links]() and [contact]()). The navigation menu sticks to the top of each page to allow easy access for users to navigate. 

### Wireframes

I created basic wireframes of how I wanted the layout of the site to look on different devices. This was done using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/).

* Wireframes were created for the about us, services, useful links and contact page. The layouts for the other pages were adopted from these so I did not find it neccessary to create separate wireframes that were nearly identical.
* The final version of the site differs in some ways due to changes that were made during the development.
    * The biggest difference 
    * This change was made to

## Design Choices
### Font

* The font used for the logo and headings is "Lato" with "sans-serif" as secondary font.
    * This font is slightly elongated, it always brings contrast to a typography combination and it's legibility is good for mobile version content consumers.  
* The font used in the body is "Oswald" also with "sans-serif" as secondary font.
    * This font complements the headings and logo and is well defined making it easy to read.

### Colour Palette

![Picture of the colour pallete used  ](assets/readme-images/colour-pallete.webp)

The colour scheme was chosen starting with a shade of brown and then using []() I found colours that compliment it and are suitable for the refugees theme.

* The  is used in the header and footer as well as a few borders and backgrounds on links and buttons.
* The  works well throughout as a background colour and font colour. 
* The  is used for font colour throughout creating good contrast.
